## Introduction and Professional Assessment

My journey into computer science began during my service as a Nuclear Machinist Mate in the United States Navy. In my last few years, I discovered coding challenges, and a passion for solving complex problems through technology followed. This newfound enthusiasm led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University, where my academic and hands-on experiences deepened my technical knowledge.

Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to engage in diverse team projects that refined my ability to collaborate effectively in dynamic environments. I led cross-functional groups including developers, designers, project managers, and clients, which sharpened my communication skills and ensured that project requirements were clearly articulated and met. Courses in Data Structures and Algorithms, along with Software Engineering, provided a solid foundation for tackling complex challenges by optimizing code for efficiency and designing robust and scalable systems. Hands-on experience in database implementation further refined my analytical skills and reinforced my commitment to data integrity and security best practices. A particularly formative experience was my internship at Blackbaud as a Software Engineer Intern, where I applied my academic knowledge to industry projects, collaborating with seasoned professionals on high-impact software development initiatives. This role deepened my understanding of agile methodologies, real-world software lifecycle management, and the importance of a robust security mindset, while enhancing my ability to communicate complex technical concepts to both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders.

This ePortfolio is a collection of artifacts that capture the breadth of my technical proficiency and problem-solving capabilities. The portfolio is organized around three core objectives:

- Software Design & Engineering

- Algorithms & Data Structures

- Databases

Each artifact demonstrates a unique aspect of my expertise. The enhancements I applied to these projects were specifically designed to meet these course outcomes:
1.	**Building Collaborative Environments:** Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.
2.	**Effective Communication:** Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.
3.	**Innovative Problem Solving:** Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.
4.	**Application of Advanced Techniques:** Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
5.	**Security Mindset:** Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

Together, these artifacts form a cohesive narrative of my growth as a computer science professional. They integrate the principles and methodologies learned through coursework with the innovative practices required for real-world solutions. Beyond the technical work, the constructive feedback from instructors and the rich discussions with peers have continuously refined my professional outlook, fortifying my unwavering commitment to excellence.

Each artifact in this portfolio is accompanied by a narrative that details the enhancements made and explains how it meets the course outcomes. A code review of the initial artifacts can be viewed by clicking the button below:
